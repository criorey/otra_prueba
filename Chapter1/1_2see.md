### Example

"_The Persistence of Memory_ depicts a surreal scene. On the left (hand) side of the painting we can see two soft melting pocket watches, one of them hanging from a tree branch, and an orange watch covered with ants. In the middle of the composition there is a third melting watch on top of a strange creature. In the background we can see some cliffs."
