### Example
Arthur Lubow has described _The Scream_ as "an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time."[^1] I agree that this painting is a true masterpiece, since it symbolizes perfectly the anguish that dominates modern society. _The Scream_ is an extremely disturbing artwork, it makes the viewer feel anxious, and provokes a sense of vertigo and fear. Actually, Munch's artwork reminds me of one of the worst crises in my life.
