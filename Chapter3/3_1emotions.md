2. What is your emotional reaction to the artwork? Does it remind you of anything?
3. What is your opinion about this artwork? 

### Example
Arthur Lubow has described _The Scream_ as "an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time."[^1] I agree that this painting is a true masterpiece, since it symbolizes perfectly the anguish that dominates modern society. _The Scream_ is an extremely disturbing artwork, it makes the viewer feel anxious, and provokes a sense of vertigo and fear. Actually, Munch's artwork reminds me of one of the worst crises in my life.

### Inserting a mathematical formula
This is an example of a mathematical formula written in LaTEX.

$$\left|{1\over N}\sum_{n=1}^N \gamma(u_n)-{1\over 2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\gamma(t){\rm d}t\right| \le {\varepsilon\over 3}.$$
