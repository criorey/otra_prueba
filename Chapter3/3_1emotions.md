### Example
Arthur Lubow has described _The Scream_ as "an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time."[1]_The Scream_ [^1] is a true masterpiece, I believe that it symbolizes perfectly the anguish that dominates modern society. This painting is an extremely disturbing artwork, it makes the viewer feel anxious, and provokes a sense of vertigo and fear. Actually, Munch's artwork reminds me of one of the worst crises in my life."

[^1]: _The Scream_ (Norwegian: _Skrik_) is the popular name given to each of four versions of a composition, created as both paintings and pastels, by the Expressionist artist Edvard Munch between 1893 and 1910.
